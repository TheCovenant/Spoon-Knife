I think working on a web application will be good because I already have some experience with some frameworks like React.

I think if I'm working on an established open source project like quacs then I will need to use a blessed repository (forking) because I will likely not have read/write access on the original repository.

If I am starting a project from scratch then I can use a common repository and work with collaboraters on an original repository.s
